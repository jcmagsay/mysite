# mysite

This is my personal website, which can also be found at http://jillianmagsaysay.com. My site is not currently up and running. I've just changed my hosting provider and have an open ticket I'm resolving with the host service.

To run it locally, you need to do the following:

1. Download mysite to your local machine.
2. Install NodeJs. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Open Node and cd to the "mysite" directory after downloading 
4. Run npm install
5. Run npm start
6. Open a browser and go to localhost

Did these steps not work?
Please shoot me an email at jcmagsay@gmail.com and I will assist you getting this setup locally on your machine.
